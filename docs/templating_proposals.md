# Possible solutions

## 1

The following command generates a secrets in the templates directory

```console
kubectl create secret generic --dry-run=client eu-secret --from-literal=secret='myEuropeanSecret' -o yaml | kubectl neat > templates/secret.yaml
```

Then we'll enclose the environment variable definition with a condition depending on the region in the deployment template.

```yaml
          {{- if eq .Values.global.region "eu-west-1" }}
           - name: eu-secret
             valueFrom:
               secretKeyRef:
                 name: eu-secret
                 key: secret
         {{- end }}
```
## 2

First of all we need to add a new value

```yaml
printIP:
  enabled: True
```

Then this command will generate a job yaml

```console
kubectl create job my-ip --dry-run=client --image=busybox -o yaml -- wget -qO - http://ipinfo.io/ip | kubectl neat > templates/job.yaml
```

If we enclose the whole yaml, it won't be created if the boolean is False.
With the hook annotation here, the job will be created before any other resource will be applied.
We defined a delete policy "hook-failed" in order to keep the job, otherwise it would have been deleted.

```yaml
{{- if .Values.printIP.enabled -}}
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
 name: my-ip
 annotations:
   "helm.sh/hook": pre-install,pre-upgrade
   "helm.sh/hook-weight": "1"
   "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": hook-failed
...
{{- end -}}
```

If we want to keep the deployment easy to read, we would prefer adding the code in the _helpers.tpl

```yaml
{{/*
Environment variables
*/}}
{{- define "web.envVars" -}}
{{- range $key, $value := .Values.envVars }}
- name: {{ $key }}
  value: {{ $value }}
{{- end }}
{{- end -}}
```

Then this new variable could be used in the deployment as follows

```yaml
         env:
          {{- include "web.envVars" . | nindent 12  }}
```

The common labels can be changed in the file templates/_helpers.tpl. Here's a proposal
This one is tricky, I needed to dig back into the charts available in the stable github repository.

```yaml
codename: {{ printf "%s %s %s" (.Release.Name | trunc 3) .Chart.Name (now | date "20060102") | snakecase }}
```

## 5

Here's an option to achieve the expected results.

```yaml
         env:
           - name: ETCD_HOSTS
             value: "{{ range $index, $e := until (.Values.etcd.count|int)  }}{{- if $index }},{{end}}etcd-{{ $index }}{{- end }}"
```
